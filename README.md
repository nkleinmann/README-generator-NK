# README-generator-NK

This program creates a high quality README. Run node index.js in the terminal in the correct directory and an unique README will be generated for any project.

Technologies used:
JavaScript and node.js

Challenges: 
This is the first project using inquirer. Organizing code and understanding the logic to generate the README took some trial and error and debugging.  At first, I was not able to access the generateMarkdown.js file correctly.  Attending study groups and reviewing discussions in slack helped me understand the logic needed in this project and the correct syntax to access the generateMarkdown.js file!
